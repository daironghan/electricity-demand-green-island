# Temporal Analysis of Electricity Demand on Green Island

## Description
This project predicts and analyses Green Islandâ€™s (Ludao) electricity demand at a high temporal resolution using
historical weather data, population trends, and tourist activity. Please view the [poster](https://github.com/daironghan/electricity-demand-green-island/blob/main/poster.pdf) for complete details and results. 

### Dataset
The [dataset](https://github.com/daironghan/electricity-demand-green-island/blob/main/2017_2024_data.xlsx) was collected from multiple resources including the Central Weather Administration, Taitung County
Government, and Taiwan Power Company. Data preprocessing was done to fill in null values, more detail can be found in the [poster](https://github.com/daironghan/electricity-demand-green-island/blob/main/poster.pdf).
